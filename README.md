We welcome contributions of any size, whether they are major features or bug fixes, but please note that all contributions will be thoroughly reviewed.

### Commit Message

When you make changes to one or more files, you need to commit those changes with a commit message. Here are some guidelines:

- Keep the commit message short and detailed.
- Use one of these commit types as a prefix:
  - `feat:` for a feature, possibly improving something already existing.
  - `fix:` for a fix, such as a bug fix.
  - `style:` for features and updates related to styling.
  - `refactor:` for refactoring a specific section of the codebase.
  - `test:` for everything related to testing.
  - `docs:` for everything related to documentation.
  - `chore:` for code maintenance (you can also use emojis to represent commit types).

Examples:
- `feat: Speed up compiling with new technique`
- `fix: Fix crash during launch on certain phones`
- `refactor: Reformat code in File.java`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If youâ€™re using `Artario` on a phone or Android emulator, you can use the normal version. However, the WSA `(Windows Subsystem for Android)` version is recommended for WSA users, as it leverages the `/Windows/Artario/` directory integration to provide benefits such as fast access to exported images, projects, and text styles.

## Disclaimer

This mod was not created for any harmful purposes, such as harming Sketchware; quite the opposite, actually. It was made to keep Sketchware alive by the community for the community. Please use it at your own discretion and consider becoming a Patreon backer to support the developers. Unfortunately, other ways to support them are not working anymore, so Patreon is the only available option currently. You can find their Patreon page [here](https://www.patreon.com/sketchware).

We do NOT permit publishing Sketchware Pro as it is, or with modifications, on Play Store or on any other app store. Keep in mind that this project is still a mod. Unauthorized modding of apps is considered illegal and we discourage such behavior.

We love Sketchware very much and are grateful to Sketchware's developers for creating such an amazing app. However, we haven't received updates for a long time. That's why we decided to keep Sketchware alive by creating this mod, and it's completely free. We don't demand any money :)
